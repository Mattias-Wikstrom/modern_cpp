This repo contains examples of modern C++ code. The code is based on examples from a book ('C++ for Dummies' by Stephen R. Davis) that I used to teach myself C++ back in 1994.

Link to the original C++ code (see PART3.TXT and BUDGET5.1.CPP): https://archive.org/details/c-fd_20221007 .

Additions: This repo now contains code in other languages besides C++, largely AI-generated.
